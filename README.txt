# Basic Level 1 Authentication Project

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of user authentication using **Node.js**, 
**Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. It includes basic registration and login functionality, 
allowing users to create accounts and log in to access restricted pages. 
This project serves as a practical application of the skills learned in web development, database handling, and server-side programming.

## üìñ Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Practice foundational skills in setting up a Node.js and Express server.
- Connect a Node.js application to a PostgreSQL database.
